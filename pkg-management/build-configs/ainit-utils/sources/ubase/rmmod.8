.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
removes one or more modules from the kernel.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
This option can be extremely dangerous: it has no effect unless
CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD was set when the kernel was compiled.
With this option, you can remove modules which are being used, or
which are not designed to be removed, or have been marked as unsafe.
.It Fl w
Normally,
.Nm
will refuse to unload modules which are in
use. With this option,
.Nm
will isolate the module, and wait until the module is no longer used. Noone
new will be able to use the module, but it's up to you to make sure the
current users eventually finish with it.
