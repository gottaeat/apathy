apathy
======
apathy is a linux "distribution" built on top of apathy-mlfs, which can be
found at https://github.com/mssx86/apathy-mlfs, for my own purposes. it uses
musl libc, libressl, partially busybox and a home-brewed init structure written
in posix shell.

because it is intended for my use only, this repository does not contain an
image to boot from or a stage3 tarball to unpack, though it is possible to
build a system using the base that apathy uses.

history
=======
versioning is done solely for defining the "era" of apathy that used different
compontents, it does not mean anything.

    1. mssLinux 1.1, apathy gnu/linux 1.{2,3}:
       - it initially used linux from scratch 8.4 as its base and the rest was
         built off of reading gentoo ebuild's and arch linux PKGBUILDS.
       - first iterations of utilities under apathy-utils/ is written here.
         same goes for ainit-sysv-mk-i which is just a posixified version of
         lfs-bootscripts so that i could boot with dash.
       - latest state of this "release" can be found at the apathy-glibc branch
         of this repo.

    2. apathy musl 1.0
       - it used "mlfs" written by github user dslm4515 as its base and the
         rest was built off of reading alpine APKBUILD's.
       - pretty much everything else is straight from the glibc apathy.

    3. apathy musl 1.1
       - i forked mlfs to apathy-mlfs. cleaned up the documentation, simplified
         things, changed the shells, the init system, updated majority of the
         software alongside with patches, and used it as the base for this
         "release".
       - pretty much everything else is the same as the previous mlfs based
         system.

    4. apathy musl 1.2 - part 1
       - having sold my g3258 and bought a thinkpad t61, i decided on
         rebuilding the system as the previous haswell chip had instructions
         that my core2 duo in the t61 didn't have.
       - the `init-functions` and `rc` from lfs-bootscripts got rewritten and
         named `ainit-sysv-mk-ii`. instead of doing runlevel based symlinking,
         now `rc` handled everything by case statements. the whole structure
         got much more portable to move between init's.

    5. apathy musl 1.2 - part 2
       - i removed the runlevel management bits from rc and moved the already
         portable ainit-sysv-mk-ii to sinit. instead of util-linux and coreutils
         bits, i used components from static sbase and ubase builds.
       - at this stage, instead of blindly taking the build recips from alpine,
         i started trimming down the fat and writing my own recipes more. the
         size of the distribution went down from 1450mib to 960mib without
         losing functionality.
